# Easymoeny-Onlinebank-
Data Scientist, who will help in this new stage to increase the profitability of the current client portfolio !!
***
easyMoney was born almost 4 years ago from the imagination of Carol Denver, an investment banking professional, who after more than 10 years
working for large firms, decided to launch her own business project: a multi-channel platform for marketing financial products (savings, investment,
financing) with a friendly interface. It would allow customers to find solutions to their financial needs and to acquire them in a simple way. Their
first product, the easyMoney piggy bank account (accumulate money in your piggy bank effortlessly and automatically by rounding up your
purchases) was a great success, after which they have been expanding the product offering with investment solutions, cards, etc.
As it did not have a bank behind, easyMoney allied itself with easyBanking S.A. in its launch, an entity supervised by the Bank of Spain that acts as a
product factory. However, as its only supplier, it exercises great power in easyMoney's commercial strategy, and that is generating tension in the
relationship between the companies. On the other hand, thanks to Carol's contacts and tireless spirit, easyMoney undertook up to 2 rounds of
financing that allowed investing in customer acquisition during the first year. The results was exceeding the target business figures of the launch
plan and reaching a staff of almost 100 people and a revenue of several million euros.
After 4 years of activity, easyMoney is facing some challenges that put its continuity at risk: the addition of products to its catalogue due to pressure
from its easyBanking partners has changed the initial vision of offering simple products to just respond to customer needs. Furthermore, the
funding obtained in the rounds has almost run out, without yet obtaining the expected positive EBITDA that allows them to start walking alone. The
main investor, Lion Global Management, is asking for obtaining profitability from the current client base before further investment. On the other
hand, the high turnover in the IT team and the lack of investment in technology is beginning to generate problems in all areas of the company,
which complain of not having adequate means of work. Last but not least, internal tensions in the company are holding back the agile spirit that
characterized the first developments. In this context, and after the departure of one of the members of the Marketing team assigned to fundraising,
easyMoney's management has decided to fill this vacancy with the incorporation of a Data Scientist, who will help in this new stage to increase the
profitability of the current client portfolio.
